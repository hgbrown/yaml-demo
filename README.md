# Spring Boot Yaml and Properties Files mix demo

Demonstrates how we can use a combination of configuration defined in both a 
Yaml and Properties file in a Spring Boot application.

We want to be able to access any configuration element in both the build file
and the application components without having to repeat any configuration.

We do this by importing the additional configuration file into the main 
application configuration file.
